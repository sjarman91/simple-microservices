# very simple microservices example

Includes:
1. A Hapi.js API gateway
2. A NATS server (for internal communication between the microservices and the gateway)
3. A identity-service that allows users to signup and view all users that have signed up.

To start:
1. Have docker and docker-compose set up and installed
2. `docker-compose build`
3. `docker-compose up`
